# NASA-Space-App-Challenge-2025
Our project is a web-based pollution prediction platform that uses machine learning and real-time weather APIs to forecast air quality for the next 24 hours. The system collects environmental data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pollutant concentrations from the MeteorMatics API and WAPI (Weather API). Using the past three months of data, our model identifies patterns in pollution levels and predicts the air quality of a user-selected location. If the forecast indicates unsafe pollution conditions, the website instantly displays an alert notification, encouraging users to take precautionary measures before going outdoors. The site also includes a solar system quiz, combining awareness with engagement to make learning about environmental and space science enjoyable.

This project benefits users by providing early warnings about poor air quality, helping them protect their health and plan their day safely. It transforms complex environmental data into simple, actionable insights, making pollution awareness accessible to everyone. Built using VS Code, Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js, the system emphasizes prediction accuracy, real-time performance, and user-friendliness. Overall, it has a positive impact by promoting health-conscious behavior, inspiring environmental responsibility, and supporting the broader goal of creating cleaner and safer communities.
